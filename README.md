# Digital-Image-Watermarking-and-Its-FPGA-Implementation
My seminar topic as a part of BTech course in ECE. I would be first implementing different schemes of frequency domain watermark embedding and then implement the best one on FPGA. 

## Libaries Used 
1. OpenCV (for Image reading and writing)
2. PyWavelets (for DWT)
3. Numpy 
4. Scipy (for DCT)

## A Brief About Digital Image Watermarking 
The act of concealing a message connected to a digital signal (e.g., an image, song, or video) inside the signal itself is known as digital watermarking. Its primary application is to safeguard digital media copyright.

### Frequency Domain Watermarking Embedding 
In frequency domain watermarking techniques, values of certain frequencies are altered from their original. Because higher frequency alternations are lost during compression, these frequency changes are usually made at the lower frequency levels. The watermark is applied to the whole image to prevent it from being erased during geometricÂ
